<b>Writing Guidelines And Theme.</b><BR><BR>
</font></center>

<font face="verdana" style="font-size: 10pt; color:black">
<b>Staying In-Character:</b><BR><BR>
</font>

<font face="verdana" style="font-size: 10pt; color:black">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tempest MUD is strictly roleplaying, therefore the zones
and rooms must stay in-character and in-theme. This will be given a
loose leniency when it comes to singular mobiles and rooms.  For
instance, if you wanted a mobile named "Fenrir" which was a huge
wolf, it would be fine.  However, creating an entire zone in the theme
of Norse mythology would not be acceptable. Within your own judgment,
try and maintain the basic theme, and intermix any real life or
mythological references that you deem appropriate. Any zone submitted
is subject to change or non-use if the implementors disapprove. Please
be aware that we reserve the right to change the placement or use of words
at our own discretion.<BR><BR>
</font>

<font face="verdana" style="font-size: 10pt; color:black">
<b>Maintaining Theme Relevance:</b><BR><BR>
</font>

<font face="verdana" style="font-size: 10pt; color:black">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four quadrants of the world. Each one is mainly,
but not totally, in the theme of the patron God of that section.
Pick one of the four areas, and write a zone for it. It can be a
city, a dungeon, a cave, a mountain... Anything. Use your
creativity to work out themes, events, history, people, monsters...
Again, anything. The Tempest zone (the large storm in the center
of the world), as well as the capital cities of the four nations,
will be strictly written by the implementors, so please don't write
anything for those. Aside from those 5 zones, anything goes. Keep
in mind that natural as well as man-made borders prohibit access to
the nations themselves. You can't write a zone that moves from one
nation into the other. As said, pick one, and write in that theme.<BR><BR>
</font>

<font face="verdana" style="font-size: 10pt; color:black">
<b>Hydecka - The Warrior City-State:</b><BR><BR>
</font>

<font face="verdana" style="font-size: 10pt; color:black">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A military state whose inhabitants worship Tarkus, the
Warrior God.  Hydecka is a heavily armored nation with many castles
and cities.  Many militant regimes, some in the service of the
capital and others independent, exist across the land.  Hydecka is
in the Southeast quadrant of the world, and its capital city is
Damascus, where the king (played by a mortal character whose name
is subject to change) resides and commands the national army.  It
is surrounded by the man-made Wall of Jericho, which blockades all
access save through the Diamond Gates to the West and North, as
well as the Tempest to the Northwest.<BR><BR>
</font>

<font face="verdana" style="font-size: 10pt; color:black">
<b>Almeccia - The Holy Kingdom:</b><BR><BR>
</font>

<font face="verdana" style="font-size: 10pt; color:black">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A deeply religious kingdom which honors the memory of the
Goddess of Light, Elora.  Elora is the patron Goddess of Clergy,
and of those who practice the healing arts.  There are many temples
and shrines of ornate architecture across Almeccia.  The villages
that lie on the outskirts of the kingdom are modest and inhabited by
humble, faithful peasants.  The entire landscape of Almeccia is
bright and sacred.  Almeccia is in the Northeast quadrant of the
world, and its capital city is Lourdes, where the High Clergy
governs the nation.  The Southern border is blockaded by the Wall
of Jericho, while the Western Border is guarded by the impassable
Diamante mountain range.  The Tempest lies to the Southwest.<BR><BR>
</font>

<font face="verdana" style="font-size: 10pt; color:black">
<b>Ravenna - The Shadowlands:</b><BR><BR>
</font>

<font face="verdana" style="font-size: 10pt; color:black">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dangerous landscape of dark forests, murky swamps, and
tall black mountains.  Ravenna is the domain of Genevieve, the
Goddess of Deception and Stealth.  This is the dwelling place of
the most talented Assassins and Thieves in the world.  Ravenna is
in the Northwest quadrant of the world, and its capital city is
Odessa, a misty fort that serves as home to the Shadow Guild, an
order of adept Rogues who rule the land from the shadows.  The
frightening Diamante mountains stand tall to the East, preventing
access to the Holy Kingdom, while the thick, deep forest of
Terracyon provides secure protection to the South.  The Tempest
lies to the Southeast.<BR><BR>
</font>

<font face="verdana" style="font-size: 10pt; color:black">
<b>Volaris - Mage Country:</b><BR><BR>
</font>

<font face="verdana" style="font-size: 10pt; color:black">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Volaris is the homeland of Scholars and Mages.  The
students of Academics and Wizardry alike pay homage to Aristal,
the Mage God.  Though not as spectacularly stunning in appearance
as the grandiose cities and castles of the East, Volaris has many
large cities that serve mainly as centers for education and research.
Volaris is a slightly dark, mysterious, exotic land.  Many strange
and curious things can be seen there, while some things there cannot
be seen at all.  Volaris is in the Southwest quadrant of the world,
and its capital city is Scion, a huge Castle and Academy from where
the Council of Elder Mages govern the land.  To the North, Terracyon
Forest prohibits access into Ravenna.  To the East lies the Wall of
Jericho, barring entry into Hydecka.  The Tempest lies to the Northeast.<BR><BR>

<font face="verdana" style="font-size: 10pt; color:black">
<b>Clan Writing:</b><BR><BR>
</font>

<font face="verdana" style="font-size: 10pt; color:black">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will accept writing and ideas from anybody that wants
to propose clan ideas, or if you want to start your own clan even.
However be aware that we will judge this material slightly more critically
than the zone writing, as we can only allow clans to be put in if all of
the implementors agree that the theme is proper.<BR><BR>
</font>

<font face="verdana" style="font-size: 10pt; color:black">
<b>Make Your Own Story:</b><BR><BR>
</font>

<font face="verdana" style="font-size: 10pt; color:black">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tempest MUD will be a rich world with heavy themes of politics
and religion, all roleplayed by human players. Kings, officials and even
the Gods themselves will ALL be roleplayed by human players. Normal
mortal characters will have the option to come out of character on certain
private channels, but Gods will ALWAYS be in character, and never reveal
who their human player is. As a builder, you may have the option to play
a God character yourself. You can incorporate new ideas for your own
Immortal into your zones and sub-themes.<BR><BR>
</font>

<font face="verdana" style="font-size: 10pt; color:black">
<b>Scion Library:</b><BR><BR>
</font>

<font face="verdana" style="font-size: 10pt; color:black">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The Library of Scion will be an in and out of game collection of literature written in-character by the players of
Tempest MUD. These will serve the purpose of expanding on the game theme, as well as providing the players with a
medium for applying their talents to the game. Contests and Quests will be held periodically as an opportunity for
players to use their artistic talents and publish their winning works in the library of Scion, in the game, and on
the Tempest website. They will also receive permanent unique legend marks in the game, in recognition of their achievements.<BR><BR>
