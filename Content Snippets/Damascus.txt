So seldom visited, and only by a few, the back of the armory looks more like a residence than a shop.
An aged wooden table accompanied by four chairs, a tall bookcase, and a large chest make up the most
of the furnishings of this small room. A well-used grindstone just inside the door on the left is
surely responsible for the impeccable edge found on the bladed weapons for sale in the front of the
shop and a countertop opposite the grindstone provides a sturdy place to clean and polish pieces of
armor. In this quiet little room is where the armory's owner spends much of his time. His attendent
does quite well running the front of the store alone and the owner's presence is rarely required. Instead,
he is free to polish armours and sharpen swords at his leisure.
