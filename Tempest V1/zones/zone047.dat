BEGIN
#gBa'Degra Swamp#N
Everything about the scenery seems to say that you are not welcome here. Tall,
skeletal trees tower all around you like ghostly sentinels. Many are packed so
close together that it's impossible to see beyond the barrier they create, much
less go that way. Beyond the trees and fallen branches there is not much to see
im this oppressive wasteland. The only thing green here is the cold and brackish
water that comes almost to your knees and sucks at your feet with every step.
The sounds of your passage through the murk is the only sound here. It's quiet
here, too quiet..

LOOK 4700 north
BEGIN
Stretching north is a gap between the foliage that is about the size of a common
road. Now if only if the way was dry...
END

LOOK 4700 south
BEGIN
To the south lies the way out of the swamp, where its boundaries are clearly
marked.The murky water tapers off from mud to sickly grass and the bare trees
and shrubs give way to more lively looking specimens.
END

LOOK 4700 trees
BEGIN
All of the trees here appear to have died long ago, though they rise high above
the water where their gnarled roots are tangled. Their smooth trunks and
leafless branches are the color of bone.
END

LOOK 4700 water
BEGIN
You don't want to think of what might be in this water, much less drink it. It's
bad enough you're standing in it.
