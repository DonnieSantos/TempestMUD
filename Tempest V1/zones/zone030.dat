#rThe Order of the Bloody Rose#N
Before you lies a silvery, yet somewhat rusty, metal gate atop a foot-high slab of vermilion stained concrete.
Aside from this sanguine stepping stone, nothing apparently prohibits your entrance, save two stone statues that
stand vigilant on each side of the gate. The creaky hinges seem to be time frozen, which would imply that the gate
has been open for quite some time, as it is now. Similarly, the iron heart-shaped handles on each side of the gate
seem to have not been touched in ages. The two life-like statues are a bit intimidating, yet you feel that they are
not the only danger that lies in store for the hapless intruder. Perhaps you should examine your surroundings a bit
more carefully before you proceed.

LOOK 3000 north
BEGIN
Just beyond the open gate, there seems to be a widening space leading into a more open area. The narrow path must
have been used as a means of keeping watch over the entrance into this territory. Looking even closer, you can see
some type of stone construct, perhaps a small fort, in the near distance to the north. Judging from the
hauntingly realistic appearance of the two stone assassins guarding the gate, you realize that this must be the
base of operations for some very dangerous people. It's probably not a good idea to go in uninvited.

BEGIN
Upon closer examination, you see that the two statues guarding the gate are in the likeness of two female assassins.
They strike a similar pose, each holding a dagger with a clenched fist, pointed downwards, held firmly against their
left breast. Both have their eyes closed. The image suggests that they are giving some type of solemn salute to
an unknown figure, with their weapons held to their hearts. Even with closed eyes, you can feel them watching you.

#rJust Inside The Gate#N
The narrow path through the thick forest has widened on this side of the gate. You are standing on the far southern end
of a circular field, enclosed on all sides by the dense tree formations. The ground is covered in yellow and orange leaves,
equally distributed throughout the large circle. The confined area is somewhat empty, except for another large statue just
to the north, and the entrance to the fort just beyond it. You can see that under the mesh of colorful leaves, the
ground below your feet has a strange hint of red amidst the brown dirt.

To the south of here lies the always open, yet always protected gate which leads into the circle of blood.
END

LOOK 3001 north
BEGIN
Just north of here, you see a statue that is at least twice the size of the gate guardians, standing tall
at the center of the circle of blood.
