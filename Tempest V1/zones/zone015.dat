#rThe Front Gate of Odessa#N
You stand before the gate of a massive, fortified stronghold. This is the grand
capital city of Ravenna, which is said to have been founded by Genevieve well
over two-thousand years ago. At first glance, the rust-red portculis seems
relatively unguarded, considering the importance of this city. Upon further
examination of the huge granite walls to the left and right of the gate, your
keen senses alert you to the presense of life atop the wall, and you suddenly
feel as if there were a thousand arrows aimed at your heart. Not much can be
seen besides the sturdy walls, aside from the obvious four towers rising up from
the corners of the city. Riding the Southwest tower and blowing in the wind you
can make out a large black flag with a single red rose pictured in the center.
It is very much the color of blood.

#rInside The Front Gate#N
Having passed the first wall, you now face a second. It was obviously the
intention of the architect to keep out any uninvited guests; the only way to go
from here is to the east or west, both of which pass through narrow trenches
between the two thick walls. There are guards patrolling the trenches in both
directions. In addition to them, you can now definitely make out archers posted
atop the walls. Those posted on the outer wall continually scout the landscape
for attackers, while those on the inner wall seem to be alternating their aim
between the trenches and the inner city. Apparently the idea of honor among
thieves is not acceptable enough for the city guards. You feel safer knowing
this. Who knows what kind of shady characters are lurking about this place?

chains and various other projectile weapons for sale. Even the shop itself is
high-priced, with red silk curtains, a velvet carpet and crystal cabinets.
Standing in the midst of this wealth is young Danai Daravon, the latest member
of the family, who was named after the most famous Assassin in the clan's

The armory is a giant room filled with display cases containing fancy looking
armours fit for rogues. Right near the entrance, the most expensive armours are
on display; Brigandines and Circlets are mounted on decorated stands, just
begging to be looked at. Their primary competition is Cendrillon herself, who
just behind the counter, equally deserves to be looked at. Along the side and
back walls, various other items are on display; sturdy gloves, boots, cloaks and
bracers seem to be in great abundance. All of this equipment seems to be top of
the line, and you can't seem to find anything cheap or common. Cendrillon prides
herself on a choice selection of equipment, as can easily be inferred by her own
expensive outfit. It looks like you'll have to try another store if you want
something on the lower end.

a king or a queen. The spike-like forms which contain the rubies are quite sharp
on top, for some odd reason. The rubies themselves give the odd appearance of
being wet with fresh blood, ready to drip at any moment.

#r#MThe Dark Mist Jewelry Store#N#N
This shop is draped in black curtains on all sides with a narrow opening near
the entrance, which is visibly eminating grey mist through the drapery. The
interior is shrouded in this cool mist, and you feel as relaxed as you could
possibly feel in such an ominous place. Around the perimeter of the shop, there
is not much to be seen; mostly the mist forms cloudy patches which make it look
as if you were completely encircled and trapped. Nearing the center, however,
there are stands and cabinets full of ornate and expensive looking jewelry, all
decorated lavishly with precious metals and gemstones. Zora, an intimidating
magess in black robes, stands tall behind the selection, watching the room
carefully. To your surprise, there are no enclosures guarding these precious
items; they are all out in the open for anybody to touch, apparently. But then
for a split second you thought you saw a faint blue light, like invisible magic
glass, appear over the jewelery as Zora shifted her eyes. Unless it was your
imagination, she must have some sort of magic barrier in place, just in case she
needs to remove some unwanted fingers.

#r#bA Dark Alley#N#N
The very light seems to disappear as you make your way down this dark alley, and
after walking a bit further you realize you've hit a dead end. You can barely
make out the blackish brick walls in all directions but east, the way you came.
However, just in front of you now, you can make out a cloaked figure standing in
the darkest corner of the alley.
