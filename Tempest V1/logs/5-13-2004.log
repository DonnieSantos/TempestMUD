[1:26:12 192.168.1.1 Genevieve    ] (101) say Well my thesis isn't just about that, that's just one thing I have to use =P
[1:26:24 68.149.253.83 Ava        ] (101) say I figured that
[1:26:30 192.168.1.1 Genevieve    ] (101) say That's a tool for reducing dimensionality
[1:26:38 68.149.253.83 Ava        ] (101) say Neat
[1:26:52 192.168.1.1 Genevieve    ] (101) say My thesis is improving querying speeds for huge data sets, like medical research databases
[1:27:9 192.168.1.1 Genevieve     ] (101) say Like maybe searching through databases of catscan images or huge DNA sequence strings
[1:27:19 68.149.253.83 Ava        ] (101) say That would be helpful
[1:27:34 192.168.1.1 Genevieve    ] (101) say Obviously those types of things are huge in number of dimensions, that's why I gotta do this crap at the beginning
[1:27:44 68.149.253.83 Ava        ] (101) say Ah I getcha now

[1:28:44 68.149.253.83 Ava        ] (101) say Is it readable?
[1:29:5 192.168.1.1 Genevieve     ] (101) say Reduce dimensionality, cluster, and then index for queries.
[1:29:20 192.168.1.1 Genevieve    ] (101) say I pretty much finished the second part, yeah it's kinda readable...
[1:29:27 192.168.1.1 Genevieve    ] (101) say But it's kinda boring.
[1:29:35 68.149.253.83 Ava        ] (101) say I read it when you finished it all

[1:29:49 192.168.1.1 Genevieve    ] (101) say It has its moments
[1:29:53 68.149.253.83 Ava        ] (101) say More or less cos I don't have a damn what it's about :p
[1:29:54 68.149.253.83 Ava        ] (101) smile
[1:30:4 68.149.253.83 Ava         ] (101) say You know..the ignorance is bliss concept
[1:30:6 192.168.1.1 Genevieve     ] (101) say I'll try to explain it better when I write my paper. :)
