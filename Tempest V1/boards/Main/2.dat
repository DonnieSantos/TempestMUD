Updates.
Check the immortal command list (imm) for new commands.
Also, the syslog is in, so that should help.

Please always be on the lookout for output flaws, such
as lines of text that look like they were grouped or
spaced incorrectly in their display.  We have a new
output system implemented, so it needs testing.
