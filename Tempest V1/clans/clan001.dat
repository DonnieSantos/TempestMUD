[BEGIN]
Bloody Rose is the oldest clan in the known world,
founded by Lady Genevieve and her most loyal followers some
350 years before the millenium. At this time, the world was
not yet completely out of touch with the Gods, but was in
its waning moments of grace. It became apparent to Genevieve
that it would now be in the hands of humans, not Gods, which
would ultimately determine the course of the future. Thus,
the Loyal Blades gathered themselves near Odessa and pledged
eternal loyalty to Genevieve and each other. The first clan
was born, a pact of kinship among humans with a common
interest. The glorious religions of the past were fading,
but the time of man was at hand, and spread across the world
as other clans formed. Bloody Rose is a clan of simple yet
intractable philosophy; Loyalty above all. Our members will
protect each other with their lives, and take the lives of
those who would hinder us. In our eyes, morality is
secondary to loyalty; we welcome even the most ruthless
Assassins into our fold if their heart is true to our cause,
while our enemies and traitors color our sanguine blades.
