[BEGIN]
Far to the Northwest, deep within the dark forests of
Ravenna, you will find Golgotha, the Temple of Genevieve. It
is here that the most loyal worshippers will sojourn to pay
homage to the Lady of Shadow in the Church of Pain. The
Golgothian Priests and Disciples of Genevieve are fearsome,
but also dependable. Dangerous, but also dignified. Cunning,
but not unworthy of trust. The right kind of person will
find this fellowship to be quite welcoming and fulfilling.
The wrong kind of person might end up at the business end of
a dagger. Genevieve repays loyalty with love, but casts the
wretched aside in pieces. She decorates her very heart with
the devotion of her loving children, but paints the walls
with the blood of the faithless.
