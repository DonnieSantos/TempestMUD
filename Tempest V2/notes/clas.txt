  | Warriors are masters of close combat who specialize in all  |
  | forms of weaponry and armor. They are durable and strong.   |
  | While they rely mainly on brute force to get them through   |
  | rough situations, not all Warriors are without skill. Some  |
  | experienced Warriors can learn a variety of attack skills,  |
  | and in some cases even beneficial spells to enhance their   |
  | protection and perception.                                  |

  | At level 10, Warriors may become a Paladin or Anti-Paladin. |

  | Warriors who stay pure to their profession, and never       |
  | deviate into the study of other arts, may receive special   |
  | abilities and the unique title of Master Warrior. While     |
  | there are, of course, huge advantages to the specialized    |
  | Warrior classes, and |the long journey to level 99 as just  |
  | a Warrior is certainly more difficult, there may be some    |

  | Knights are more chivalrous and less barbaric than common   |
  | Warriors. They abide by a code of conduct, and loyally      |
  | serve their masters when wartime arises. Knights have more  |
  | expertise in the area of weaponry and armor than Warriors,  |
  | but are not nearly as vicious or aggressive. Their superior |
  | equipment as well as the addition of some beneficial spells |
  | do, however, make the Knight class far more versatile. A    |
  | Knight who is aligned with the Light may become a Paladin.  |
  | Paladins are Holy Knights who possess magical healing       |
  | abilities and extra armored protection at the cost of       |
  | damage capabilities. Dark aligned Knights may become        |
  | Anti-Paladins, who also possess some magical abilities, but |
  | receive their true gain in the area of raw damage and the   |
  | ability to kill quickly and efficiently. In general, all    |

  | Berzerkers have taken the aggressive philosophy of a        |
  | Warrior to a new level. Not very concerned with magic or    |
  | skills, Berzerkers strive to increase damage and physical   |
  | protection over all other things. They are Warriors who     |
  | have become overzealous with the concept of warfare, and    |
  | can be completely overtaken by their battle-driven emotions |
  | at any time. Those who have been drawn towards the Light    |
  | may find themselves a Crusader, who also has great          |
  | close-combat abilities, but specializes mostly in defense,  |
  | and does not have quite the ferocity of a Berzerker's       |
  | attacks. Drawn to the Dark from a path that is already      |
  | dangerous, a Death Knight is a fearsome combination of      |
  | combat prowess and evil intent. They are the ultimate war   |
  | machines; their only desire is to destroy. In any case, all |
  | Berzerker types are strictly within the realm of pure       |
  | physicality and overpowering strength, and do not have much |
  | in the area of skills and spells.                           |

  | Assassins are killers. They are the most adept and skillful |
  | of all professions. They use these skills to execute        |
  | specialized attacks with knives and projectiles, often      |
  | dealing staggering critical damage. While not as versatile  |
  | as a common Thief, the Assassin is by far a more effective  |
  | combat profession. They are relatively weak defensively,    |
  | but more often than not, the opponent of an Assassin may    |
  | not even see their attacker until a knife is in their back. |
  | This way of life, ironically, stands on the edge of a       |
  | knife--Always on the verge of falling into the Light or     |
  | Dark. Assassins who become overly fond of killing to the    |
  | point where they do it out of enjoyment instead of          |
  | necessity are known as Shadowblade. The Shadowblade are a   |
  | fearsome variation of the Assassin, even more adept at      |
  | stalking through the shadows and killing silently. So much  |
  | is the case, that they lose efficiency in most of the other |
  | areas of combat. On the other hand, some Assassins come to  |
  | the realization that their skills can be used for good, and |
  | protection of others. They become Rangers, masters of       |
  | projectile weapons. They excel in tracking and scouting.    |
  | Their marksmanship has no equal. All Assassins can kill     |
  | quickly, but when and how they choose to do so depends on   |
  | the individual.                                             |

  | Rogues answer to no one. They live by their own rules, and  |
  | do whatever they please. A Rogue is not so combat-minded,   |
  | but more concerned with their own prosperity, and usually   |
  | monetary gain. They do have many useful combat skills,      |
  | though, to rely upon when they must fight. In fact, a Rogue |
  | is a bit more robust defensively than the common Thief or   |
  | even an Assassin. However, their attacks are not nearly as  |
  | effective. The true power of the Rogue lies in their        |
  | non-combat skills. Rogues have mysterious abilities in the  |
  | realm of weapons and item lore. Most shopkeepers are Rogues |
  | who abandoned combat completely and became Merchants. The   |
  | Merchant class is essential to the prosperity of others.    |
  | Rogues and Merchants will often be asked for assistance in  |
  | various areas from other classes who lack the skills to     |
  | accomplish their goals. However, some Rogues decide that    |
  | the best way to earn their gold is to fight. They become    |
  | Mercenaries, and will wage war against anybody that their   |
  | employer commands, regardless of morality. Mercenaries are  |
  | far more formidable in combat than Rogues, but they lose    |
  | many of their non-combat skills. All Rogues, though, have a |
  | vast and indescribable array of skills that differ          |
  | depending on the inclinations of the Rogue in question.     |

  | Druids are those who have dedicated themselves to achieving |
  | a higher level of combat effectiveness. While not           |
  | necessarily aligned with the dark or light, Druids are      |
  | often of a neutral inclination, and are primarily concerned |
  | with their ability to use magic for healing and protection. |
  | To this end, they are more effective than the common        |
  | Cleric. The deeply religious Druid with firm beliefs may    |
  | become a Priest. The Priest above all other classes are     |
  | leaders in the church, and set a shining example for all    |
  | those of their faith. They are also the greatest healers in |
  | the land, although are not quite as well-rounded in a       |
  | combat sense as other Clerics may be. Not all religions are |
  | of the light, and not all Cleric magic is laced with good   |
  | intent. The Druid who is equally as faithfull as a Priest,  |
  | yet feels himself compelled to the darkness, becomes the    |
  | feared Dark Cleric. Not everything is known about the Dark  |
  | Cleric, but it is said that they hold black masses, learn   |
  | dark attack spells, and wish curses upon the rest of the    |
  | world. They use their magical powers for the malcontent of  |
  | society, or for their own selfish purposes. They do possess |
  | healing powers, but are not concerned with the welfare of   |
  | others. They may, if anything, use such powers to heal      |
  | those who would kill their enemies.                         |

  | Monks are drawn towards the realm of physicality, in slight |
  | abandon of their magical abilities. The Monk can fight      |
  | using their bare hands with good results. They still        |
  | possess some of the magical healing powers that their       |
  | Cleric background taught them, but they now focus on        |
  | non-magic skills as well. In addition, Monks will often be  |
  | very wise in the areas of lore. Their knowledge of herbs    |
  | and potions is vast. It is this that often leads them to a  |
  | new path. A Monk who decides that herbalism and potion      |
  | making are more interesting than fighting may become a      |
  | Healer--A master of herbal lore. A Healer dislikes combat   |
  | in general, but may gladly lend their assistance to those   |
  | who need potions to heal various ailments. Often, a Healer  |
  | will be a simple merchant, spending their days preparing    |
  | and selling their creations. Like all things, the lore of   |
  | concocting potions has a dark side. Those who study long    |
  | and hard to conceive and create liquid poisions and bottled |
  | curses are known as Alchemists. Famous for trying to create |
  | gold of out lead, the Alchemist is selfish and mischievous; |
  | Not to be trusted. The like-minded may find their skills    |
  | invaluable, but beware of their treachery, and do not drink |
  | anything they offer if it looks suspicious.                 |

  | Wizards take destructive magic to a new level. They are     |
  | masters of the elements and wielders of immense arcane      |
  | power. Their power is so great that they may consume a      |

  | Mage, may have varying degrees of versatility; while some   |
  | Wizards may only concentrate on destruction, others may be  |
  | balanced with a wide variety of magical abilities. There is |
  | no telling just what kinds of things a Wizard can do, in    |
  | and out of a combat situation. Those that are decidedly     |
  | bent on destruction and nothing else may become a Warlock.  |
  | The Warlock is the ultimate destroyer, and wields terrible  |
  | explosive magicks. They suffer in various other aspects of  |
  | combat, and may often be anathematized from society, but    |
  | the quality of their assistance in times of conflict is     |
  | never questioned. Not all Wizards are hell-bent on          |

  | balanced and versatile spell caster. While still possessing |
  | great destructive power, the Sorcerer has many other useful |
  | spells that can be used in combat as well as in other       |
  | situations. Sorcerers are looked up to and respected in     |

  | The Illusionist uses forgotten magicks and deceptive        |
  | techniques to damage and confuse their foe. Inherently      |

  | necessarily light or dark, you never know what lies in the  |
  | mind of an Illusionist. Their phase shifting powers can     |
  | lead them to two very different paths. The light aligned    |
  | Illusionist realizes his potential for summoning Familliars |
  | from another plane or dimension, and calls upon them for    |
  | assistance in times of need. They are called Summoners.     |
  | However, those that realize the dark arts of phase          |
  | manipulation upon one's own body can become Shapeshifters.  |
  | These abominations can change their own physical form to    |
  | that of a monstrous beast. Of all Mages, the Shapeshifter   |
  | is the only one who can act as a melee fighter at times.    |

  | Thieves are somewhat strong physically, but are quite weak  |
  | in comparison to Warriors. The true power of all            |
  | Thief-based classes lies in their skills and specialized    |
  | abilities. When focused on one thing, the Thief can excel   |
  | like no other. A master of stealth and speed, Thieves rely  |
  | on their wits and agility to lead them to victory, no       |
  | matter what their purposes are. The skills that they learn, |
  | though, rely heavily upon their choice of profession. For a |
  | Thief more than any other class, one's profession can make  |
  | a world of difference in what you can and cannot do. They   |
  | are very specialized, so choose carefully.                  |
  |                                                             |
  | At Level 10, a Thief may become an Assassin or a Ranger.    |
  | Type 'help classes' for information on changing classes.    |
  |                                                             |
  | Thieves who stay pure to their profession, and never        |
  | deviate into the study of other arts, may receive special   |
  | abilities and the unique title of Master Thief. While       |
  | there are, of course, huge advantages to the specialized    |
  | Thief classes, and |the long journey to level 99 as just    |
  | a Thief is certainly more difficult, there may be some      |
  | subtle or yet unknown rewards for accomplishing this.       |

  | Mages are scholars and powerful attack magic users. They    |
  | are fiercly intelligent, although very weak physically. The |
  | adept magic user dedicates his life to the study of the     |
  | arcane, and believes in mind over matter. A vast array of   |
  | knowledge and an arsenal of attack spells are the weapons   |
  | of the Mage, and his philosophy is that a good offense is   |
  | the best defense. Mages cannot absorb damage well--They     |
  | will more likely try and destroy the source before it has   |
  | the chance to attack. Some Mages that do not care for       |
  | combat might lead a life of study and solitude, but more    |
  | often than not they are formidable adversaries when         |
  | conflict arises.                                            |

  | At level 10, a Mage may become a Wizard or an Illusionist.  |
